# puppet-aws-s3

Get files from AWS S3 or S3 compatible API like Ceph or Cleversafe.

## Requirements

```gem install aws-sdk``` (at least 2.x.x)
```gem install hash_validator```

Ensure to ```include s3``` in your catalogue so those gems get installed. 

## How to use

**List of available parameters:**
- **access_key_id**: Used to set credentials statically
- **secret_access_key**: Used to set credentials statically
- **region**: The AWS region to connect to. The region is used to construct the client endpoint.
- **endpoint**: A default endpoint is constructed from the :region
- **ssl_verify_peer**: Verify ssl peer
- **force_path_style**: When set to true, the bucket name is always left in the request URI and never moved to the host as a sub-domain. 

The s3 resource is instanciated as such:

```ruby
s3 { '/path/to/file/on/my/local/filesystem':
    ensure              => present,
    source              => '/bucket/path/to/object',
    access_key_id       => 'mysecret',
    secret_access_key   => 'anothersecret',
    region              => 'us-west-1',
}
```

For S3 Compatible API:

```ruby
s3 { '/path/to/file/on/my/local/filesystem':
    ensure              => present,
    source              => '/bucket/path/to/object',
    access_key_id       => 'mysecret',
    secret_access_key   => 'anothersecret',
    region              => 'dummy',
    endpoint            => 'https://my-endpoint.com'
    ssl_verify_peer     => false,
    force_path_style    => true
}
```

## Setting

Parameters can be setting up from:
- resource class
- config file

First the provider look for resource class and after for a config file

### resource config

```ruby
s3 { '/path/to/file/on/my/local/filesystem':
    ensure              => present,
    source              => '/bucket/path/to/object',
    access_key_id       => 'mysecret',
    secret_access_key   => 'anothersecret',
    region              => 'us-west-1',
}
```

### Config file

```ruby
s3 { '/path/to/file/on/my/local/filesystem':
    ensure => present,
    source => '/bucket/path/to/object',
}
```

**aws_config.yaml** in puppet config dir

    ---
    :access_key_id: access-key-id
    :secret_access_key: secret-key-id
    :region: dummy

    # S3 compatible
    :endpoint: https://my-endpoint.com
    :ssl_verify_peer: false
    :force_path_style: true


This provider support the md5 check file. If you set:

```ruby
s3 { '/path/to/file/on/my/local/filesystem':
    ensure => latest,
    source => '/bucket/path/to/object',
}
```

It will compare the **s3 remote file etag** with the **md5 checksum of local file**.
If it's false, the **local file** will be replaced by the **s3 remote file**.
